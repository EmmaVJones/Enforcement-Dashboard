PLANTING WILL OCCUR IN ZONES TO ACCOMMODATE APPROPRIATE WETLAND VEGETATION OVER A PERIOD OF THREE PLANTING INSTALLMENTS. THE SITE WILL INITIALLY BE DRAWN DOWN FOR BETTER ESTABLISHMENT OF
THE SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION. AFTER THE GROW-IN PERIOD IS COMPLETE, NORMAL WATER LEVELS WILL BE RESTORED AND THE PROPOSED FORESTED/SCRUB-SHRUB AREAS WILL BE PLANTED WITH WOODY VEGETATION PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE 2010 GROWING SEASON. THIS PLANTING WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE PLANTING OF THE LOW MARSH AREA AS SOON AS THE EMERGENT PLANT MATERIAL CAN SAFELY BE TRANSPLANTED. SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION WILL BE PLANTED IN AREAS OF THE POND OVER 1' DEEP AT NORMAL POOL, WHILE LOW MARSH EMERGENT PLANTING WILL OCCUR IN SHALLOW WATER BELOW NORMAL POOL ALONG THE FRINGE OF THE POND. THESE PLANTINGS WILL MIMIC THE ADJACENT WETLANDS IN PLANT MATERIAL, DOMINATED BY THREEWAY SEDGE, ARROW ARUM, AND SPATTERDOCK. AREAS RECEIVING FREQUENT INUNDATION WILL BE TYPIFIED BY SCRUB-SHRUB PLANTINGS ALONG THE PERIMETER, CONSISTING OF BUTTONBUSH, MARSH MALLOW, WINTERBERRY, AND HIGHBUSH BLUEBERRY.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
This order was written in response to a violation of the State Air Pollution Control Board Consumer Product Rule in 9VAC5-45.

These rules are developed to comply with SIP requirements and often have the potential to apply to nontraditional stationary sources, such as, sources that are not located within Virginia (manufacturers and suppliers of products) and multiple retail store chains (distributors of products).  The actual emissions from consumer products usually cannot be attributed to a single location, since they are used wherever the consumer takes them after purchase.

For this reason they are applicable only in VOC Emissions Control Areas designated in 9VAC5-20-206 and specifically referenced in the rule.  Currently, the rule only applies in the Northern Virginia and Fredericksburg VOC Control Areas.  Although these areas reside within the DEQ Northern Region, future violations and orders will be applicable in multiple VOC Control Areas and across regional boundaries as nonattainment designation and the SIP change.

Therefore, DE decided that this Order (the first related to the Consumer Products rule) should be written in Central Office and that the related compliance and enforcement files will also remain with and be managed by Central Office staff.",,"N",2010-05-23,2010-05-23,2010-05-23,,,,2010-09-01,,,2010-09-09,2011-02-03,,,"This order was written in response to a violation of the State Air Pollution Control Board Consumer Product Rule in 9VAC5-45.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
September 2012 - Whilte Lotus, LLC sold property and USTs to Andrew Kevin Settles.  We have been unable to reach Mr. Settles, and Whitel Lotus has been unresponsive. 2/26/2013 - Site Visit with Doug Carl (remediation).  Business closed, building and site in very poor condition.  Mr. Settles did not show up as planned.  2/26/2013 - I was able to speak with Mr. Settles for the first time.  Discussed site status, and explained current non-compliance.  I also brought him up to speed on past non-compliance.  He thought he had paperwork to clear up the past non-compliance.  Site Visit Log given to Compliance staff to follow-up on new issues.       Mr. Pinkesh Patel, made efforts to bring facility back into compliance through 2012, but sold the facility to Mr. Andrew Kevin Settles on September 11, 2012, due to economic hardship.  Consequently, White Lotus LLC went out of business.  White Lotus LLC was defunct according to Virginia SCC online records, and has now been purged.  Enforcement has tried unsuccessfully to contact Mr. Patel, due to unanswered mail, and disconnected phone.  The Facility has not been in operation since June 01, 2006, according to Mr. Patel, DEQ inspectors, and Registration forms. The release investigation was the last remaining unresolved issue from White Lotus LLC, and the PC would be later closed under the new owner in 2014.
On September 12, 2012 DEQ received a Notification for Underground Storage Tanks, Form 7530-2, changing the ownership to Andrew Kevin Settles (<U+FFFD>Mr. Settles<U+FFFD>).

01/03/2017: Site visit scheduled for January 17, 2017.  Only one issue in the NOV remains to be resolved, the countersinking of two culverts.  If a resolution can be reached regarding this issue, will proceed with case closure.
01/11/2018: Meeting was rescheduled.  Meeting set for January 24, 2018.  USACE is now going to attend the site visit because the RP failed to submit plans prior to beginning work.
01/24/2018: RP disagrees with the culvert assessment.  DEQ/USACE (Julie Hamilton)/County/RP are going to meet to discuss the culvert issue.  New sedimentation impacts of approximately 1000 LF; DEQ/USACE will meet on site next week to discuss the corrective action.
02/08/2018: Conducted a site visit with the USACE.  Culvert is not counter sunk properly but sedimentation around the culvert may fix the problem.  Will check in May 2018 to see if the culvert has self corrected.  The inspection results regarding the 1000 LF of stream are inconclusive as to the origin of the sediment, waiting on the inspection report for final analysis.
02/13/2018: Spoke with John Lain (804-775-4381) about the NOV and path forward.  Said we were waiting for the final inspection report before Enforcement knows what the next steps will be.
02/27/2018: The USACE is unable to proceed with a violation for the sedimentation of the stream because of the origin of the sediment is inconclusive.  Plan to fix the culverts is due in two weeks.
03/14/2018: DEQ agrees with the CAP regarding the Culverts.  Will reinspect in late May.

Warning letter was sent on 1/22/19: ""The engine-generator (Ref. No. G-1) was started up during the October 18, 2018 FCE. Visible emissions at the time of the inspection appeared to exceed the 5 percent opacity limit of this Condition. Based on the observations made during the inspection, it appeared that EPA Method 9 may be needed. On October 23, 2018, DEQ personnel (Cameron Stewart, Justin Wilkinson, and Paul Foxwell) conducted a Visible Emissions Evaluation (VEE) of the engine-generator (Ref. No. G-1). The VEE was conducted from 1100 -1120 EST. During this observation period, the facility had multiple 6-minute averages that exceeded the 5 percent opacity limit of this Condition. The highest 6-minute average opacity during the observation period was 21.7. The lowest 6-minute average opacity during the observation period was 16.7. Visible emission observation forms and a data summary table are attached to this inspection report. Based on the observations made during the VEE, the facility appears to be out of compliance with this Condition."" Case assigned to BDH. -- 9/24/19, BDH

Refer to BR13-1103 (Open Enforcement Action).

DEQ issued an Amendment to the 2011 Order on August 13, 2012 (2012 Amendment; BR12-0412) to extend the timeline of the 2011 Orders Schedule of Compliance.

They were amenable to restarting the permitting process as soon as someone let's them know what is needed.  Apparently, the original permitting plan was to issue a GP for the crusher yet when it became known that crushers were not eligible for GPs (except at quarries, in general), permitting requested February 2019 a new Form 7 for an IP for the crusher yet Hill Sand & Gravel did not send in a new application.

Sewage from a private mobile home park is collected through a lateral line and directed to the public sewage collection system.  The discharges occurred due to damage caused by debris (trees, logs, etc.) hitting and hanging on the private sewer lateral aerial crossing of the South Fork Powell River during a flood event.  Once it was determined that the sewer lateral was privately owned, Town personnel contacted the Property Manager for Riggs Rental, LLC, owner of the trailer court.  Repair of the aerial crossing could not be done until water levels receded.  Removal of debris was completed.  Pipe was ordered on March 30, 2020, but there was a delay in being able to get delivery of pipe required to meet specifications such that it could be connected to the Town of Big Stone Gaps sewage collection system.
